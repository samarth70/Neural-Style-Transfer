# Neural-Style-Transfer

I have worked on pretrained model from Tensorflow Hub and tried to study the concepts of generative adverserial networks.
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique which is used here to take two images-a `content image` and a `style reference image` and blend them together so that the output image looks like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style reference image.
