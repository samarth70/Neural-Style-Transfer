# Neural-Style-Transfer

I have worked on pretrained model from Tensorflow Hub and tried to study the concepts of generative adverserial networks.
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images-a content image and a style reference image and blend them together so that the output image looks like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style reference image.
